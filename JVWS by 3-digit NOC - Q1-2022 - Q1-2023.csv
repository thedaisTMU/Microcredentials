3,"An economic region (ER) is a grouping of complete census divisions (with one exception in Ontario) created as a standard geographic unit for analysis of regional economic activity. Canada has 76 ERs that are classified in accordance with the <a href=https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/12-571-X2016001"">Standard Geographical Classification (SGC) 2016</a>", which is based on 2016 Census boundaries. The Job Vacancy and Wage Survey (JVWS) publishes estimates for 69 ERs, seven of which are combined. These seven combined ERs are the same as those published by the Labour Force Survey. Maps illustrating the ERs, as well as a table showing the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs) within each ER," are available by selecting the “JVWS Geographical Maps” link at the bottom of the JVWS survey page (<a href=""http://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=5217"">5217</a>)."""
