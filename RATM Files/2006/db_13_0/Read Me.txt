New in 13.0
-----------

** Tasks **

The layout of the Tasks data has been improved in this release. The
information previously in "Tasks.txt" can now be found in the three
files "Task Statements.txt", "Task Ratings.txt", and "Task
Categories.txt". For more information, please consult the O*NET Data
Dictionary 13.0 (see below).

As a convenience to developers who have imported Tasks data from
earlier releases, the 13.0 Tasks data is provided separately in the
layout used by the O*NET Database releases 5.1 through 12.0. To
download this separate package, visit the Supplemental Files page at:

http://www.onetcenter.org/supplemental.html

** Work Needs **

Work Needs ratings, previously available in the "Work Values.txt"
file, have been moved to a separate download package. Developers
who wish to use these ratings can download the data from the
Supplemental Files page at:

http://www.onetcenter.org/supplemental.html

** Work Values ** 

For each occupation, a Work Values high-point profile describing
the top three work values is now available.
